# Request for Biosolids Soil Carbon Research Data Sets

Virginia Tech researchers Mike Badzmierowski, Greg Evanylo, and Lee Daniels have recently been funded to quantify carbon sequestration potentials from land-applied biosolids from analysis of existing data. Our methodology will involve a meta-analysis of published and unpublished data. We are requesting the use of your raw and/or refined data that will enable us to achieve our project objectives, i.e., 

1.	Estimate the effects of land-applied biosolids on soil organic C stocks through explanatory factors such as biosolids processing methods and characteristics, climate, land use, and soil properties across temporal scales to improve the quantification of C sequestration credits. 
2.	Identify research gaps in biosolids land application research with regard to C sequestration potential, and provide a framework for consistent data collection to improve future analyses in the form of an open-access data repository. This will include evaluations of various methods for whole soil C sampling and verification.
3.	Communicate results with sponsors, wastewater treatment plants, policymakers, and environmental scientists through open-access publication and conference meeting presentations.
